FIT:    data read from tablename using (log10($1)):(log10($2))
        format = x:z
        x range restricted to [0.00000 : 1.10000]
        #datapoints = 12
        residuals are weighted equally (unit weight)

function used for fitting: f(x)
fitted parameters initialized with current variable values

The fit was stopped by the user after 26780 iterations.
final sum of squares of residuals : 7.81056e-86
abs. change during last iteration : -1.56289e-88


Hmmmm.... Sum of squared residuals is zero. Can't compute errors.

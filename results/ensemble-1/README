    Fixed Time ensemble simulations modified
    
    A major change to how these simulations are done. Now, for each
    realization, the agents aren't deleted and recreated from scratch.
    Now, agents are created only once in the begnning, and for each
    realization, they are simply put back into their original location, and
    their scores are preserved. The scores are incremented at each
    realization.
